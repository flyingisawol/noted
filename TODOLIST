// feed. to fix:
// only show notes from people you're following
// stop rendering of notes until all info has been fetched. ie: profile pic, name, content etc.
// if image exists in note, render image appropriately.
// correctly render linebreaks etc.
// need to modify this so the npub is not hard coded.



// only show notes from people you're following
// steps: 
// need to know how user is following. search for follow list.
// then need to filter feed by the list of npubs.


// fetchFollowList()
// hex pubkey currently hardcoded in. store this in state var on login and add dynamic value to function.
//

// App.tsx
// problem: if i do not click login button and refresh the app, the pubkey is not stored in state.
